It does also support embedding videos from different sources. Here are some examples:

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.liquid path="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jNQXAC9IVRw" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jNQXAC9IVRw?si=y5b0JEljEmrytDki" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
