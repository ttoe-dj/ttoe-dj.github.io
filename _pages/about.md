This site is about physical theories of everything, as a continuation of my [PhD study](http://hdl.handle.net/10012/19734).

<details>

<summary>Scope</summary>

I take a theory of everything to contain at least the following components: 

#### 1. Dynamical law
What variables to use to describe the physical universe? What laws govern them? These are some main topics of **particle physics** and **quantum gravity**.

#### 2. Boundary condition
What boundary conditions to apply to in conjunction with the dynamical laws? This is a major topic of **quantum cosmology.**
  
#### 3. Empirical prescription
How to derive empirical predictions given the dynamical laws and bounary condition? This question is difficult in quantum physics because of the measurement problem, which is a major topic of **quantum foundations**.
