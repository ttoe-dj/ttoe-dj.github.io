<summary>Scope</summary>

I take a theory of everything to contain at least the following components: 

1. Dynamical law

What variables to use to describe the physical universe? What laws govern them?

2. Boundary condition

What boundary condition to apply to in conjunction with the dynamical laws?
  
3. Empirical prescription

How to derive empirical predictions given the dynamical laws and bounary condition?

The first topic is studied in **particle physics** and **quantum gravity**, the second in **quantum cosmology**, and the third in **quantum foundations**. These delinate the scope of this site subject-wise.

<summary>Methodology</summary>

#### Credence

What's the correct approach to quantum gravity? No one knows for sure.

How to proceed facing difficult questions like this? Write down possibilities; assign credences based on current clues; discover new clues; update credences; repeat till the answer is clear.

#### Priority

What clues to prioritize for discovery? Those that change credences most. E.g., a result that rules out an otherwise promising approach.

What projects to avoid when planning? Those that change credences least. E.g., trying to promote a ruled-out approach without addressing the issue.
