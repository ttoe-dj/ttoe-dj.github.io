This site is about physical theories of everything, as a continuation of my [PhD study](http://hdl.handle.net/10012/19734).

<details>

<summary>Scope</summary>

As of current, I take a viable theory of everything to contain at least three components: 

<details>
<summary>1. Dynamical laws</summary>
Part of the task is to identify the correct physical degrees of freedom, while part of it is to find the correct dynamical laws governing those degrees of freedom. In contemporary physics, these are the main topics of particle physics and quantum gravity.
<details>
  
2. Boundary conditions
The dynamical laws must be supplied with boundary conditions toward making predictions. In contemporary physics, the study of boundary conditions is a main topic of (quantum) cosmology.
3. Empirical prescriptions
To qualify as a theory of everything, the theory must offer an unambiguous prescription for extracting empirical predictions. This task is non-trivial in quantum theories because of the measurement problem. In contemporary physics, the measurement problem is a main topic of quantum foundations.
