Here are some clues I use to update my personal credences on topics associated with theories of everything. Positive/negative clues are labeled by +/-; the more marks, the more it affects my credence.

#### Gravity

___

##### Framework

Which theoretical framework would the correct theory of gravity be based in?

{% tabs framework %}

{% tab framework path integral %}

- No difficulty for accommodating matter fields of the Standard Model. (+)
- Works whether or not spacetimes in superposition follow a common time foliation (+)

{% endtab %}

{% tab framework Wheeler-DeWitt equation %}

- Seems impractical for accommodating matter fields of the Standard Model. (-)
- How to extract empirical predictions from $$\psi$$ that obeys the Wheeler-DeWitt equation? Converse, would the mathematical object actually useful for extracting empirical predictions obey the Wheeler-DeWitt equation? (- -)
- The Wheeler-DeWitt equation would not hold if the lapse is positive for our universe (see, e.g., Section IV.A of [Ref](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.43.1170)). (-)

{% endtab %}

{% tab framework Schr√∂dinger equation %}

- Seems impractical for accommodating matter fields of the Standard Model. (-)
- Still works if spacetimes in superposition do not follow a common time foliation? (- -)

{% endtab %}

{% tab framework algebraic quantum theory %}

- What replaces the microcausality axiom when spacetimes are allowed in superposition? (- -)

{% endtab %}

{% tab framework not quantum theory %}

- Unclear if any non-quantum framework reproduces the success of the quantum framework for the Standard Model of particle physcics. (- -)

{% endtab %}

{% endtabs %}
