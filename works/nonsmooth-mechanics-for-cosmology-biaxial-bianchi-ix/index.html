We demonstrate how unilateral (inequality) constraints on cosmological scale factors yield novel bouncing solutions, overcoming the traditional Big Bang breakdown. These solutions feature a “singular bounce” where one biaxial scale factor momentarily vanishes with zero velocity, while the other scale factor is fixed by the cosmological constant at a positive constant. These classical real-valued bouncing solutions form dominant saddle points in the Lorentzian gravitational path integral, offering a physically preferred alternative to complex saddles and suggesting that initial boundary conditions need not be fixed at small scale factors. Our analysis provides new insights into the dynamics of the early anisotropic universe and offers a concrete mechanism for evolving cosmological solutions beyond singularities.</p> <h5 id="version-history">Version history</h5> <ul> <li>Original versions: Article v1.0</li> </ul> <h5 id="access">Access</h5> <p>Instead of giving the copyright for free to a publisher, I sell this paper myself for profit.</p> <p>Visit the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.30759.66721" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ResearchGate page</a> for a preview of the paper.</p> <p>Click the button below to purchase the full paper (the cost covers the current and all future versions of the paper).</p> <script type="text/javascript" src="https://payhip.com/payhip.js"></script> <p><a href="https://payhip.com/b/bCJ6f" class="payhip-buy-button" data-theme="green" data-product="bCJ6f" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Purchase full paper</a></p> </body></html>
