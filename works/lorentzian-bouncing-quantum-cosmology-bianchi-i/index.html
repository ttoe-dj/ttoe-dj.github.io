As a consequence, the contour needs to be bounded by the diverging point for the path integral. Moreover, tunneling/no-boundary type boundary conditions become ineffective since making the initial scale factor vanish would also make the path integral vanish for large lapse. For these reasons we study the Bianchi I path integral for Lorentzian and quasi-Lorentzian contours under general boundary conditions. Perhaps surprisingly, this straightforward quantization of General Relativity governed by the Einstein-Hilbert action already exhibits bouncing effective geometries at the semiclassical level. If all one wants is a bounce, all one needs is dance, with the real time path integral and without ad hoc postulates for new matter, new dynamics, or new variables.</p> <h5 id="version-history">Version history</h5> <ul> <li>Original versions: Article v1.0; Notebook v1.0</li> </ul> <h5 id="access">Access</h5> <p>Instead of giving the copyright for free to a publisher, I sell this paper myself for profit.</p> <p>Visit the <a href="X">ResearchGate page</a> for a preview of the paper.</p> <p>Click the button below to purchase the full paper (the cost covers the current and all future versions of the paper).</p> <script type="text/javascript" src="https://payhip.com/payhip.js"></script> <p><a href="https://payhip.com/b/eAMyw" class="payhip-buy-button" data-theme="green" data-product="eAMyw" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Purchase full paper</a></p> </body></html>
