The lack of a systematic method to impose the lightcone constraint in higher than 2 dimensions presents an obstacle in proving ergodicity for Monte Carlo simulation algorithm of locally causal dynamical triangulation, in applying Monte Carlo simulation for Lorentzian simplicial quantum gravity, and in studying superposition of time order. In this work, we provide a method to compute the lightcone numbers at any point of a 3D Lorentzian simplicial geometry, which allows the imposition of the lightcone constraint. The method is applied to show that simplicial geometries realizing superposition of time order is generically present in 3D. The method should also be useful in Monte Carlo simulations for Lorentzian quantum gravity, and in further extensions of the method to higher dimensions. A Mathematica notebook is provided with the source code of the method for applications.</p> <h5 id="version-history">Version history</h5> <ul> <li> <p>Original versions: Article v1.0; Notebook v1.0</p> </li> <li> <p>Updated edge lightcone numbers: Article v1.1; Notebook v1.1</p> </li> </ul> <h5 id="access">Access</h5> <p>Instead of giving the copyright for free to a publisher, I sell this paper myself for profit.</p> <p>Visit the <a href="X">ResearchGate page</a> for a preview of the paper.</p> <p>Click the button below to purchase the full paper (the cost covers the current and all future versions of the paper).</p> <script type="text/javascript" src="https://payhip.com/payhip.js"></script> <p><a href="https://payhip.com/b/KP6Zj" class="payhip-buy-button" data-theme="green" data-product="KP6Zj" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Purchase full paper</a></p> </body></html>
