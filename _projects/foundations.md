The community of quantum foundations is like a computer running on DOS operating system. It's outdated.

People often come to conclusions about quantum physics in general by analyzing models and theories from intro textbook of quantum mechanics or quantum information. The conclusions often collapse when checked against discoveries made even in the 1970s. {to do: exemplify}

I'm on a campaign to learn, study, and clarify what hold and what don't hold against up-to-date knowledge. Some criticisms along this line can be found in [Jia2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11549). Much more needs to be debunked.
