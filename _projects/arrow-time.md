The literature on arrows of time in classical physics is vast. The literature on arrows of time in quantum physics is tiny. I think this is bad, because classical physics is outdated by quantum physics.

In the tiny literature on arrows of time in quantum physics, most of what I read is problematic for sloppy thinking (see the first part of [Jia2024](works/physics-experience-life-iii-arrow-of-time/) for an exposition of some sloppy thinkings {To do: elaborate}).

In [Jia2024](works/physics-experience-life-iii-arrow-of-time/), I develop an approach to explain arrows of time with reference to explicitly modeled experiential and living systems in quantum theory.

The explanation is based on a toy model universe (a quantum cellular automata). I hope to see to what extent it applies to more general and realistic situations.
