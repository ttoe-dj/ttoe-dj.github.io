##### Description

Title: Experience and temporality in quantum physics

Author: Ding Jia

Abstract: It seems reasonable to assume that experience supervenes on physics, but how exactly? Does experience supervene on instantaneous physical configurations, or on processes extended in time? I contrast three types of answers proposed in the literature in the context of quantum physics. Besides the extreme positions of supervenience on the instantaneous present, and on the entire past, there is a third possibility of supervenience on a thick present. The last answer justifies assigning conditional probabilities to relate experiences that unfold sequentially in time, and provides a basis to establish temporal identity for beings with experience without resorting to temporal nonlocality.
