##### Description

Title: Bullshit in physics: Everett 1957

Author: Ding Jia

Abstract: This is a brief critical commentary on Everett’s 1957 paper: “‘Relative state’ formulation of quantum mechanics”. I explain why, contrary to Everett’s hopes, pure wave mechanics forms a bad starting point for quantum gravity, does not give predictions for definite experiences, does not yield the Born rule, and provides no positive evidence for the realization of all observational outcomes.
