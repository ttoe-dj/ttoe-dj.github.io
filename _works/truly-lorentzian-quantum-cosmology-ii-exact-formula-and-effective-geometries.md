##### Description

Title: Truly Lorentzian quantum cosmology. II. Exact formula and effective geometries

Author: Ding Jia

Abstract: We derive a closed-form expression for the path integral over Lorentzian metrics in the homogeneous and isotropic minisuperspace setting. The result corrects many previous works by a reflection term, which is a weighted product of a path integral from the initial boundary value to zero, times a path integral from zero to the final boundary value. As an implication, we can now continue Einsteinâ€™s equation through singularities at the level of effective classical geometries. To achieve this, the Einstein-Hilbert action and a sum over Lorentzian metrics is all one needs.
