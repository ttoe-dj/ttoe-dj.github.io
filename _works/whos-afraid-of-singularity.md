##### Description

Title: Who’s afraid of singularity?

Author: Ding Jia

Abstract: In gravitational field theories such as General Relativity, spacetime is usually described by field quantities that vary smoothly. However, variational principle under inequality constraints can produce solutions with abrupt changes. Here I propose an extension of gravitational field theories to allow nonsmooth quantities. New solutions emerge that bounce and evolve beyond singularities, as illustrated in examples for cosmology and black holes. According to the new theory, singularities are not to be feared. Instead, they are embraced at intermediate stages of well-defined nonsmooth gravitational histories.
