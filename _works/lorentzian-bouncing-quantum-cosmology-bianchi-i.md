##### Description

Title: Lorentzian bouncing quantum cosmology: Bianchi I

Author: Ding Jia

Abstract: Quantum cosmology for Bianchi I model is drastically different from isotropic models, because the anisotropy modes induce a singular inverse square potential. As a consequence, the contour needs to be bounded by the diverging point for the path integral. Moreover, tunneling/no-boundary type boundary conditions become ineffective since making the initial scale factor vanish would also make the path integral vanish for large lapse. For these reasons we study the Bianchi I path integral for Lorentzian and quasi-Lorentzian contours under general boundary conditions. Perhaps surprisingly, this straightforward quantization of General Relativity governed by the Einstein-Hilbert action already exhibits bouncing effective geometries at the semiclassical level. If all one wants is a bounce, all one needs is dance, with the real time path integral and without  ad hoc  postulates for new matter, new dynamics, or new variables.
