##### Description

Title: Semiclassical singularity is compatible with quantum singularity avoidance

Author: Ding Jia

Abstract: In quantum gravity, singularity avoidance at the quantum level is commonly expected to imply singularity avoidance at the effective semiclassical level. Although numerous models support this case, there has been no general proof. In this paper, we show that the expectation is actually not true in general. To this end, we draw a strict distinction among Lorentzian, quasi-Lorentzian, and unconstrained models, which differ by the integration domains in the scale factors or squared scale factors. When a certain symmetry condition applies, the saddle points can be found by the method of image previously employed to study path integrals on constrained domains. When the symmetry condition does not apply, the saddle points can be found by variation within the constraint boundary. In various isotropic and anisotropic minisuperspace quantum cosmology models, it is found that the Lorentzian path integrals can avoid singularities in its sum, but still possess singular bounce saddle points. Mathematically, this is because constraining the integration domain can induce saddle points on the boundary of the domain. Physically, it follows that singular bounce models can arise as effective spacetimes, even for singularity-avoiding fundamental theories.
